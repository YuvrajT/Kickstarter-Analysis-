# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

The purpose of this analysis is to consider the factors that would help us to achieve Louise's goal. Analyze the dataset in hand and exhaust the numbers for the best outcome.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis

My analysis is based on Deliverables 1 and 2. I narrowed it down to the most obvious factors that can contribute to the success of Louise's play.

### Challenges

1. When making the line chart for deliverable one, encountered difficulty in group row lables to show months, overcome by using google and using hint in module. 

2. Difficulty in finding editing options for chart since I'm Working with excel on mac platform and in virtual class we practice on windows platform. Overcome by using cross-out options approach. 

## Results:

### Two conclusions are made about the Theater Outcomes by Launch Date:

1. Most successful theater campaigns are held in summer (May/June).

2. The ratio of failed campaigns are highest in winter (Nov, Dec and Jan).

### One conclusion is made about the Outcomes based on Goals

1. Campaigns with goal of less than 5k have the highest success rate.

### Summary of the limitations of the dataset:

1. No timeline provided for Louise's play, such as start date or year.

2. No specifics of country and goal amount given.

### Recommendation for additional tables or graphs:

1. Countries that are holding the most successful campaigns in summer.

2. Average time taken by successful projects to achieve goal
